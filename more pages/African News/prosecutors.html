      <p class="card-text">South African prosecutors have stated they intend to bring charges against parliamentary
        speaker Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula, alleging corruption/p>
        <br>

      <p>South African prosecutors announced on Monday their plan to pursue the country’s parliamentary speaker,
        Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula, over corruption allegations. She is accused of accepting $135,000 in bribes over a
        three-year period, and while serving as defense minister. The charges also include the taking of a wig as a
        bribe.

        During a meeting in February 2019 at an international airport in South Africa, Mapisa-Nqakula allegedly received
        over $15,000 and the wig. Prosecutors are also claiming that the politician probably solicited an additional
        bribe of $105,000, which was not paid. The individual who allegedly offered the bribes was not identified.

        Currently on leave from her position as speaker in South Africa’s National Assembly, Mapisa-Nqakula has refuted
        all allegations of misconduct. She has also pledged to collaborate with the authorities.

        Last week, evidence was removed during a search of her Johannesburg residence.

        Accusations of accepting bribes have been leveled against Mapisa-Nqakula in the past, however, a parliamentary
        inquiry into the matter was discontinued in 2021. The allegations resurfaced last year, following revelations
        from a whistleblower, according to prosecutors.

        She has not been detained or formally accused. Prosecutors addressed her assertions during a court hearing,
        where she argued that authorities had failed to adequately inform her of the allegations, or to adhere to proper
        investigative procedures.

        Judge Sulet Potterill announced that she will issue a ruling on April 2 regarding Mapisa-Nqakula’s request for a
        temporary injunction to prevent her arrest by the police.

        Mapisa-Nqakula is additionally seeking access to documents detailing the evidence held by prosecutors against
        her. However, they have rejected the request, contending that the defendant is seeking preferential treatment.

        The African National Congress party commented on Sunday about “Comrade Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula’s special leave
        from Parliament due to law enforcement actions and allegations against her.”

        The party is preparing for the country’s national election on May 29

        It was an easily targeted spot for slave traders and gold grabbers who covertly masqueraded as traders.
        Therefore, it features prominently in the African historical narrative of capital and human exploitation by
        Europeans. Dr. Judith Spicksley, a historian at the Wilberforce Institute for the Study of Slavery and
        Emancipation (WISE) at the University of Hull, in her seminal article ‘Pawns on the Gold Coast’, describes how
        early in the trade relationship, Europeans took gold pawns as security for debt. However, as unorthodox rules
        for slave operations weakened and the lust for more gold overshadowed the emergent supply, Europeans turned
        increasingly toward the use of human pawns. This is no different from other exploitative processes that led to
        the loss of precious resources on the continent.

        Official evidence of the looting of Ashanti Gold began during the Anglo-Asante War of 1874, when Britain’s
        military invasion of the Kumasi empire, sitting on the largest gold reserves in the region, inflicted much
        damage. Armed with explosives and superior firearms, the British military went on a sordid quest for Ashanti’s
        Gold Royal regalia – like the Mponponsuo sword created 300 years ago by the Kingdom’s Okomfo (spiritual leader)
        Anokye, which led the list of looted items in 1874. Under the pretext of ending slavery, British military
        incursions and lopsided trade treaties enforced with superior military might on African leaders occurred.
        Leaders who resisted were exiled, like the Asantehene Agyeman Prempeh, who was exiled to Seychelles in 1874.

        The British established trading ports, ensuring Britain declared itself a legitimate ruler on foreign soil. The
        rulers of several African kingdoms acted as middlemen in these trades, often against their will, but had to
        consent for self-preservation. The spoils from these conquered kingdoms paid for these wars. In Asante, the
        Asantahene, ruler of the Ashanti people, signed the harsh Treaty of Fomena in July 1874 to end the war. A
        standout clause in the treaty between Queen Victoria and Kofi Karikari, King of Ashanti, was the payment of
        50,000 ounces (over 1,400kg) of approved gold as indemnity for the expenses caused to the Queen of England by
        the war. Britain incurred costs from these wars at the expense of its opponents, destroying Africa’s biggest
        empires.

        1874 wasn’t the only instance of looting. In 1896, ceremonial swords, cups, and other vital items measuring a
        palace’s royalty were stolen. In his 2020 book ‘The Brutish Museums: The Benin Bronzes, Colonial Violence and
        Cultural Restitution’, Dan Hicks, a British archaeologist, anthropologist, and professor at the University of
        Oxford, repudiates the presence of these artifacts in Western museums, which perpetuates a narrative of colonial
        superiority and cultural dominance while erasing the histories and voices of the communities from which they
        were stolen.

      Although discussions about the restitution of African artifacts predate independence in most African countries,
      they intensified in the latter half of the 20th century. Archaeologist and Nigeria’s head of the Federal
      Department of Antiquities, Ekpo Eyo, sent circulars to several European embassies in 1972 about the repatriation
      of the Benin Bronzes (thousands of 14th- to 16th-century plaques and sculptures taken by the British from the
      African Kingdom of Benin in the late 19th century) and spurred official pronouncements like the 1970 UNESCO
      Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export, and Transfer of Ownership of
      Cultural Property. This convention offers a shared framework among state parties regarding actions required to
      prohibit and prevent cultural property import, export, and transfer.

      The convention emphasizes that the return and restitution of these cultural properties are the linchpin of the
      convention, which mandates safeguarding the identity of peoples and promoting peaceful societies to strengthen
      the spirit of solidarity and stifle the expansionary rise of black-market trades across the continent.

      After 150 years, the Ashanti Gold artifacts are held in various museums around the world, including major
      museums in Europe and North America. The British Museum in London holds 32 of the 39 historical artifacts, while
      seven treasures are at the Fowler Museum of the University of California in Los Angeles. Other minor artifacts,
      which receive little attention, are held in museums such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, the
      Musee du quai Branly-Jacques Chirac in Paris, and other smaller regional museums or private collections.

      In restitution efforts for the Ashanti Gold artifacts, complex legal and logistical hurdles are at play.
      Firstly, there has to be established provenance through examining documentation, archives, and historical
      records, owing to the difficulty arising from the long years of history and multiple transfers. Variations in
      international laws governing the repatriation of cultural property also add to the myriad of challenges.
      Transporting the artifacts from current holders to their destination and settling associated legal disputes or
      financial concerns provides further complication. Collaboration among international partners toward this is
      essential for successfully repatriating these artifacts.

      In conclusion, this extensive discussion about restitution aims to deepen existing Euro-African diplomatic
      relationships. The emphasis on restitution primarily lies in its utility as a building block for reconciliation;
      it aims to rectify pre-colonial injustices, foster international dialogue, and advance the growing bilateral
      trade between countries on both continents. The Ghana restitution experience will provide the policy framework
      and lead the roundtable engagement for restitution claims from other countries in Africa. As noted earlier, this
      action will not only demonstrate contrition but also make the most declarative statement from the West and other
      collaborators regarding their penitence during this ruinous expedition in colonial Africa.
