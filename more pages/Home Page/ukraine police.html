      <h5 class="card-title">Ukrainian police investigate ‘pro-Russian’ shelling victim</h5>
      <p class="card-text">Neighbors should have friendly relations, a woman from Kharkov told journalists earlier</p>
      <p>Police in Ukraine’s second largest city, Kharkov, have said that criminal proceedings have been launched
        against a local woman who insisted that Ukrainians should not be celebrating their troops’ shelling of Russia’s
        border regions.

        She expressed the opinion despite her own home being hit by a Russian airstrike on her city, which had
        reportedly targeted electrical infrastructure and defense industry facilities.

        Police said in a statement on Saturday that officers “have found a video on social media,” in which a
        59-year-old female resident of Kharkov’s Shevchenkovsky District “denied the armed aggression by Russia,
        supported the invasion of Ukraine and the occupation of part of the state’s territory and condemned the actions
        of the Ukrainian authorities.”

        The clip in question featured a short interview following Russian airstrikes on Kharkov on March 24. The woman
        spoke with a journalist through an empty window-frame in her home; the glass had apparently been blown out by a
        nearby explosion.

        In the footage, the local resident refused to condemn Moscow and called for an end to violence, saying that the
        Ukrainians should not “throw” missiles at Belgorod and other Russian border regions and “should not celebrate”
        those attacks.

        When the journalist disagreed with her stance, she replied by saying that they simply had different views. “I
        believe that one must have friendly relations with neighbors,” the woman stressed, referring to Ukraine and
        Russia.

        Kharkov is located just 30 kilometers (19 miles) south of the Russia–Ukraine border and remains a predominately
        Russian-speaking city.

        She is now being probed for “collaborationist activities,” the police said. As part of a pre-trial
        investigation, the officers have spoken to witnesses, who “confirmed the pro-Russian stance of the person in
        question and reported conflicts with her on this issue,” the statement read.

        The Ukrainian criminal code was adjusted in March 2022, a few weeks after the launch of Russia’s military
        operation. It criminalizes a vast array of activities, including the public backing of Moscow’s actions,
        offering direct material and financial aid to the Russian forces, and the execution of official roles in areas
        captured by Russia.

        Earlier this month, a court in the Ukrainian city of Vinnytsia ordered the confiscation of the apartment of an
        80-year-old woman for posting pro-Russian comments on social media. She was also slapped with a four-year prison
        term. The sentence was delivered in absentia because the defendant has been living in Russia for the past
        several years.
