        own doorstep</h5>
      <p class="card-text">The Crocus Hall terrorist attack rallied world sympathy massively for Russia, while Biden‘s
        prime concern is to sequester Zelensky so that all is not lost</p>
      <p>With hindsight, it was not a coincidence that the retirement of US Acting Deputy Secretary of State Victoria
        Nuland was announced on March 5 so soon after her return to Washington from Kiev, where after consultations with
        top Ukrainian security officials she announced dramatically: “I leave Kyiv… more confident that, as Ukraine
        strengthens its defenses, Mr. [Vladimir] Putin is going to get some nice surprises on the battlefield and that
        Ukraine will make some very strong success.”

        Nuland did not divulge what those “nice surprises” might be, but her superiors in DC were certain to have been
        curious to know since they know her ingenuity is limitless. At any rate, we now know that within hours of the
        superhawk’s premature retirement on March 5, instructions went out from Washington to the American embassy in
        Moscow to issue an advisory that “extremists have imminent plans to target large gatherings in Moscow, to
        include concerts” and warning US citizens to “avoid large gatherings.”

        The wording of the March 7 advisory suggests that Washington was in possession of some information credible
        enough in terms of its source. Meanwhile, the UK embassy in Moscow also issued a similar advisory cautioning
        British citizens against visiting shopping centers. However, the State Department scrambled to issue a statement
        within two hours of the horrific attack on the mall in Moscow’s Crocus City Hall on March 22, declaring that
        Ukraine was not responsible.

        Yet, the very next day, President Putin stated in his address to the nation that what happened was “a
        premeditated and organized mass murder of peaceful, defenseless people,” harking back to the Nazis – “to stage a
        demonstrative execution, a bloody act of intimidation.” Importantly, Putin disclosed that the perpetrators
        “attempted to escape and were heading towards Ukraine, where, according to preliminary information, a window was
        prepared for them on the Ukrainian side to cross the state border.”

          Plainly put, the perpetrators’ Ukrainian mentors or handlers gave them instructions to exit Russian territory
          after their mission through a particular route. What remains in the realm of the ‘known unknown’ pertains to the
          chain of command.
  
          Precisely, does the trail end with Kirill Budanov, the chief of the Main Directorate of Intelligence of the
          Ministry of Defense of Ukraine (GUR) since August 2020, who had previously served as deputy director of the
          country’s Foreign Intelligence Service and specialized in covert operations inside Russia?
  
          Or – the big question is – does it go all the way to President Vladimir Zelensky, considering the far-reaching,
          explosive nature of the operation? This is the first thing.
  
          Secondly, the perpetrators did not behave like vintage ISIS killers on suicide missions nor were they answering
          the call of ‘jihad’. They were ethnic Tajiks who admitted that they were lured by money.
  
          Expert opinion based on the published videos is also that their movements inside the mall during the operation
          did not show battle skills characteristic of well-trained fighters, and they had ‘poor muzzle discipline’, which
          means they had only minimal rifle training. Simply put, the storyline that this was an ISIS attack won’t fly. It
          is intended as a red herring to confuse dumb-witted folks abroad. </p>

        That said, the US military has been ‘retooling’ erstwhile ISIS fighters who are largely unemployed nowadays
        after the deadly Russian-Iranian offensive in Syria to crush them. Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR)
        went on record as recently as February 13, saying that the US is recruiting the erstwhile jihadist fighters to
        carry out terrorist attacks on the territory of Russia and CIS countries.

        The US has sacrificed a common anti-terror principle to stick it to Putin

        According to the SVR statement, “Sixty such terrorists with combat experience in the Middle East were selected
        this year in January… they are undergoing a fast-track training course at the US base in Syria’s Al-Tanf, where
        they are being taught how to make and use improvised explosive devices, as well as subversive methods.
        Particular emphasis is paid to planning attacks on heavily guarded facilities, including foreign diplomatic
        missions… In the near future, there are plans to deploy militants in small groups to the territory of Russia and
        the CIS countries.”

        The SVR noted that “special attention was paid to the involvement of natives of the Russian North Caucasus and
        Central Asia.”

        This is not to say that the four perpetrators set out from Al-Tanf like the four knights in TS Eliot’s play
        ‘Murder in the Cathedral’. As a matter of fact, the men could have been picked up from anywhere.

        Significantly, US President Joe Biden who is not lost for words to vilify Russia on any account — even using
        abusive epithets — has in this case chosen to keep mum and would rather wait for the findings of the Russian
        investigators. The Americans appear to be nervous about what the Russian side already knows about their
        involvement in the affair. Not a single leader in the non-western world parroted the US narrative about the ISIS
        role.

        The high probability is that US intelligence had gotten wind of something brewing in Budanov’s kitchen after
        Nuland’s visit. Evidently, the prime concern of the Biden Administration is to sequester Zelensky so that all is
        not lost downstream.

        Indeed, the Crocus City Hall attack rallied world sympathy massively for Russia. It is a huge challenge of
        statecraft for Putin now to garner this outpouring of world sympathy and yet act decisively to completely uproot
        the dark forces entrenched next-door, which may involve shaking up the very foundations of the house that
        Washington built in Kiev after the 2014 coup. Eliot’s immortal lines come to mind: ‘What peace can be found / To
        grow between the hammer and the anvil?’

        Meanwhile, it is going to be an even bigger challenge for Biden to figure out the pathway for future dalliance
        with the Frankenstein he created at the doorstep of what used to be a well-groomed garden that was Europe.

      <p>The mayor of Paris has reiterated her proposal that Russian and Belarusian contestants stay away from this
        summer’s Olympic Games in the French capital, despite them being officially allowed to compete as neutrals.

        “I want to tell the Russian and Belarusian athletes that they are not welcome in Paris,” Anne Hidalgo told
        Ukrainian athletes at a training center in Kiev on Thursday, while on a visit to Ukraine.

        The International Olympic Committee (IOC) initially pushed for a complete ban on competitors from Russia and
        Belarus after the outbreak of the Ukraine conflict in February 2022. However, last December the IOC ruled that a
        limited number of people from the two countries could participate as AINs (individual neutral athletes).”
        Hidalgo told Reuters earlier this month that she would prefer for Russian and Belarusian contestants not to come
        at all. “We cannot act as if [the Russian military operation in Ukraine] did not exist,” she told Reuters.

        When asked about Israel’s Olympic participation – in the context of the Gaza war, raging since the Hamas attack
        on October 7 – Hidalgo insisted there was no comparison to be made.

        Sanctioning Israeli athletes is “out of the question because Israel is a democracy,” she stated.

        Russia has slammed the IOC’s difference in approach to Israeli and Russian contestants. Russian Foreign Minister
        Sergey Lavrov has accused the Switzerland-based body of “political activism” and called its approach
        self-discrediting.

        The maximum numbers of Russian and Belarusian athletes that can qualify for the upcoming games are 55 and 28,
        respectively. The IOC has noted that the teams are unlikely to actually meet the quota, with some 36 Russian and
        22 Belarusian athletes expected to make it to the games, according to IOC director James Macleod.

        Participants from the two nations can only compete in individual events, and not team sports, under a neutral
        flag, and are barred from the Olympic opening ceremony.

        Commenting on the restrictions faced by Russian and Belarusian competitors, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said
        the move “destroys Olympic ideals and discriminates against the interests of Olympians.” Such restrictions run
        “absolutely contrary to the entire ideology of the Olympic movement,” he insisted.
