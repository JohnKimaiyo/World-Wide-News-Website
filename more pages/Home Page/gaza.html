      <h5 class="card-title">Why the US decided to give peace in Gaza a chance</h5>
      <p class="card-text">Washington was in a difficult position at the UN Security Council over its traditional ally
      </p>
      <p>In a historic move on Monday, the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) achieved a breakthrough by passing a
        binding resolution aimed at securing a “lasting, sustainable ceasefire” in Gaza and advocating the release of
        all hostages held by Hamas since the October attacks on Israel last year.
<br>
        This momentous step forward in international diplomacy signals a potential turning point in the protracted
        Israeli-Palestinian conflict, offering a glimmer of hope for peace in a region long plagued by violence and
        discord.

        The decision by the UNSC comes after several failed attempts to broker a ceasefire. It underscores the growing
        global consensus on the urgent need to address the root causes of the conflict and pave the way for a peaceful
        settlement. The resolution, which was passed with overwhelming support from the international community,
        reflects a shared commitment to upholding international law and promoting stability in the region.
        <br>
        The US, traditionally a staunch ally of Israel, notably abstained from vetoing the resolution this time,
        signaling a shift in its approach and a willingness to engage constructively in multilateral efforts to end the
        violence – though it has said that it does not represent a change in policy. This decision reflects a
        recognition of the need for a balanced approach that takes into account the legitimate concerns and aspirations
        of both Israelis and Palestinians.

        With the UNSC resolution now enshrined as international law, all UN member states are bound by its provisions,
        setting a clear mandate for concerted action to implement its objectives. This presents a unique opportunity for
        diplomatic initiatives and coordinated efforts to de-escalate tensions, rebuild trust, and create the conditions
        necessary for lasting peace and stability in the region.
        <br>
        However, despite the optimism surrounding the UNSC resolution, significant challenges remain on the path to
        peace. The Israeli government, led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, has vowed to carry out operations in
        Rafah, a densely populated area where millions of displaced Palestinians now reside. This escalation threatens
        to further exacerbate tensions and undermine efforts to achieve a ceasefire and pave the way for meaningful
        negotiations.
        <br>
        Moreover, Israel’s position as a key strategic ally of the United States poses a dilemma for Washington, which
        has long maintained unwavering support for Israel’s security and sovereignty. While the US remains committed to
        its alliance with Israel, the changing geopolitical landscape and evolving strategic priorities have complicated
        its stance on the conflict.

        The Biden administration faces pressure from both domestic and international stakeholders to balance its support
        for Israel with a commitment to upholding international law and promoting peace in the Middle East. Should the
        US allow Israel to destroy the last remaining Palestinian holdout in Gaza, Biden will almost certainly lose the
        2024 presidential election to Donald Trump. Additionally, relations with Muslim countries would be shattered
        beyond repair, as well as endangering US military personnel in the region.
        <br>
        The prospect of a full-scale war looms large, with Israel’s military capabilities and the broader implications
        of its actions raising concerns about the potential for a regional conflict. The possibility of an invasion by
        neighboring Arab states adds another layer of complexity to an already volatile situation, highlighting the need
        for concerted diplomatic efforts to prevent further escalation and find a peaceful resolution to the crisis.

        Further, Israel’s nuclear ambiguity and so-called “Samson Option,” its rumored unofficial retaliatory policy,
        raise serious questions about whether spillover in the conflict, prompted by the state’s potential ground
        operation in Rafah, could trigger a international thermonuclear war. The situation in the Middle East thus
        represents a major threat to international security, underscoring why major countries like Russia, China, and
        Brazil have been adamant about a ceasefire.

        Despite these challenges, there are reasons for cautious optimism. The UNSC resolution represents a significant
        step forward in international efforts to address the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and provides a framework for
        meaningful dialogue and engagement. By building on this momentum and redoubling efforts to promote
        reconciliation and mutual understanding, there is hope for a brighter future for the people of Gaza and the
        wider Middle East.

        While the road to peace remains long and arduous, the UNSC resolution offers a ray of hope in an otherwise bleak
        landscape. By seizing this opportunity and working together in good faith, the international community can help
        pave the way for a just and lasting peace in the region. Now is the time for bold leadership, unwavering
        commitment, and a shared vision of a future defined by cooperation, coexistence, and prosperity for all.

      <p>The mayor of Paris has reiterated her proposal that Russian and Belarusian contestants stay away from this
        summer’s Olympic Games in the French capital, despite them being officially allowed to compete as neutrals.

        “I want to tell the Russian and Belarusian athletes that they are not welcome in Paris,” Anne Hidalgo told
        Ukrainian athletes at a training center in Kiev on Thursday, while on a visit to Ukraine.

        The International Olympic Committee (IOC) initially pushed for a complete ban on competitors from Russia and
        Belarus after the outbreak of the Ukraine conflict in February 2022. However, last December the IOC ruled that a
        limited number of people from the two countries could participate as AINs (individual neutral athletes).”
        Hidalgo told Reuters earlier this month that she would prefer for Russian and Belarusian contestants not to come
        at all. “We cannot act as if [the Russian military operation in Ukraine] did not exist,” she told Reuters.

        When asked about Israel’s Olympic participation – in the context of the Gaza war, raging since the Hamas attack
        on October 7 – Hidalgo insisted there was no comparison to be made.

        Sanctioning Israeli athletes is “out of the question because Israel is a democracy,” she stated.

        Russia has slammed the IOC’s difference in approach to Israeli and Russian contestants. Russian Foreign Minister
        Sergey Lavrov has accused the Switzerland-based body of “political activism” and called its approach
        self-discrediting.

        The maximum numbers of Russian and Belarusian athletes that can qualify for the upcoming games are 55 and 28,
        respectively. The IOC has noted that the teams are unlikely to actually meet the quota, with some 36 Russian and
        22 Belarusian athletes expected to make it to the games, according to IOC director James Macleod.

        Participants from the two nations can only compete in individual events, and not team sports, under a neutral
        flag, and are barred from the Olympic opening ceremony.

        Commenting on the restrictions faced by Russian and Belarusian competitors, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said
        the move “destroys Olympic ideals and discriminates against the interests of Olympians.” Such restrictions run
        “absolutely contrary to the entire ideology of the Olympic movement,” he insisted.
