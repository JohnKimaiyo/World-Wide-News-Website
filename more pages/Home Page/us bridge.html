      <p class="card-text">Neighbors should have friendly relations, a woman from Kharkov told journalists earlierA
        cargo vessel damaged the supports of a bridge over the Arkansas River less than a week after a deadly incident
        in Baltimore</p>
      <p>The Oklahoma State Patrol has completely closed a highway after a barge struck the US-59 Bridge over the
        Arkansas River on Saturday.

        Law enforcement is diverting traffic away from the area, to the south of Sallisaw, until inspections of the
        structure can be made, the state highway service wrote on X (formerly Twitter). There were no reports of
        injuries on the road or the barge, AP news agency quoted patrol spokesperson Sarah Stewart as saying.

        It was not immediately known what led to the collision. Video circulating on X shows the moment the barge
        impacted the bridge supports.

        The incident comes less than a week after the cargo hauler MV Dali struck and completely collapsed the Francis
        Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, killing six people. The freighter struck a support of the 1.6-mile (2.6 km) long
        structure in the early hours of Tuesday, causing it to topple into the river, taking vehicles and people with
        it.


        Operations to clear the bridge rubble weighing down the MV Dali are currently ongoing. While the cargo hauler
        and bridge rubble are blocking the way, the port city of Baltimore is unable to resume marine traffic, a key
        industry for the area. Crews have been working to cut up portions of the metal bridge, with the first section
        being lifted on Saturday.


        By some estimates, the repair bill could end up running upward of $1 billion if a whole new bridge needs to be
        erected, the Washington Post wrote on Thursday.
