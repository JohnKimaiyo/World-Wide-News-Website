      <h5 class="card-title">Weapon of mass distraction: Is the West scapegoating Islamic State over Moscow attack?</h5>
      <p class="card-text">ISIS claiming responsibility for the massacre doesn’t end matters, while Washington and
        Kiev’s reactions raise even more doubts
      </p>
      <p>It is baffling why the powers that be, instead of trying to prevent the conflict in Ukraine from going out of
        control, seem actually bent on intensifying it. The horrific terror attack in Moscow at the Crocus City Hall
        that has resulted in 139 dead and 182 wounded has added fuel to the fire. Russia is bound to react to this grave
        provocation.

      <p> The US took military action against Afghanistan after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on its soil,
        even
        though the terrorists were not Afghan. In 2003, President Bush attacked Iraq on the grounds that it had
        terrorist ties, which was not the case. Russia would have these precedents in mind while considering its
        response to the terrible terror attack it has suffered.
        President Putin has stated several times in the past, and once again in his recent interview with Tucker
        Carlson, that the CIA was involved in the Islamic insurgency in the Caucasus. As far back as 2015, he said in an
        interview with Rossiya-1 television channel host Vladimir Solovyov for a documentary film ‘President,’
        commenting on The Second Chechen War, that the West was trying to tear Russia apart by supporting terrorists,
        and that North Caucasus elements were in direct contact with representatives of US intelligence in Azerbaijan.

      ‘Radical Islamists’ carried out Moscow terror attack – Putin

      When the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, the US, along with Saudi Arabia, mobilised Islamic extremists to
      launch a jihad from Pakistani soil against Soviet forces. Central Asia, with its Muslim population, was
      considered the soft underbelly of the Soviet Union and the strategy was to de-stabilise it by provoking a
      religious conflict in the country. While Central Asian countries are today independent, they can still be used
      as springboards to strike at Russia.

      Moscow is watchful about this possibility. Russia has a large Muslim population and preserving religious harmony
      in the country would be crucial for internal stability.

      President Putin in his address to the nation after the terror attack has pointed a finger at Ukraine. The
      terrorists, he said, were heading towards the Ukrainian border and there were arrangements to take them across
      it.

      In his second address on Monday night, he went a step further, saying the attack may be only a link in a whole
      series of attempts by those who have been fighting Russia since 2014, “using the neo-Nazi Kiev regime as their
      hand.” This is a grave charge, with very serious implications.

        The US is trying to deflect attention away from any Ukrainian involvement. Immediately after the terrorist
        mayhem in Moscow, the White House spokesperson stated that Ukraine was not involved. This is unusual. Even
        before any investigation has taken place the US seems to have reached a conclusion about Ukraine’s
        non-involvement. For the spokesperson to affirm this so categorically would suggest that the US agencies would
        be aware of who is involved.

        The US, and the UK, had in early March warned their citizens in Russia to avoid mass gatherings, concerts etc.
        Very often countries do issue such advisories as a precaution because they have got a whiff of some terrorist
        attack being planned. But, for the White House spokesperson to immediately after the attack in Moscow rule out
        Ukrainian involvement raises some questions. It is not clear why Ukrainian extremist elements intending to
        target Moscow would share their plans with the US.

        On the issue of terrorism there is consensus in so many forums, be it the UN, the G7, the G20, BRICS and SCO, on
        collective action by the international community to combat terrorism. It is repeated in many multilateral
        documents that no cause justifies a recourse to terrorism.

      Russia haters

      and media Russia haters
      In this light, whatever the current differences between the US and Russia, if the US had hard information about
      the planned terrorist attack in Moscow one could argue that they should have alerted Moscow more precisely. More
      so to stave off the real possibility of Russia holding Ukraine responsible for this act. The Russians have long
      accused Ukrainian nationalists of terrorising the Russian ethnic civilian population in Donbass and also cite
      the case of pro-Russians set on fire in a building in Odessa by Ukrainian nationalists in the early days of the
      conflict, in May 2014.

      More recently, Moscow has accused Kiev of numerous terrorist attacks, including two bombings of the Crimean
      Bridge, in which civilians were killed, as well as the targeted assassinations of Russian public figures,
      including journalist Darya Dugina, the daughter of prominent Russian philosopher Aleksandr Dugin in August 202,
      and military blogger Vladlen Tatarsky. Last year, the Washington Post reported that Ukrainian security agencies
      “have carried out dozens of assassinations against Russian officials in occupied territories, alleged Ukrainian
      collaborators, military officers behind the front lines and prominent war supporters deep inside Russia.”

      Many are questioning the narrative of the West, led by the US, that ISIS is responsible for the Moscow attack.
      In their view the political intention is to deflect attention away from any Ukrainian complicity because such a
      massive attack against innocent civilians could negatively affect world opinion, especially in the Global South,
      on Ukraine as a victim of “unprovoked” Russian aggression.

      No doubt Russia has acted against Islamic State in Syria and remnants of ISIS could have planned this attack.
      However, its timing raises some doubts. It could have been planned just before the presidential elections in
      order to seriously disturb them. But then, it could have been reasoned that in that case the public would line
      up more solidly behind Putin. Committing this monstrosity after the presidential election would, however, “spoil
      Putin’s party,” as it were. And so the choice was made.

      It is widely believed that the West has used Islamic extremists in Syria to fight the Assad government.
      President Putin, while targeting ISIS in Syria, has voiced concern that these elements could present a potential
      terrorist threat to Russia, with Russia’s experience of the conflict in the Northern Caucusus in mind, when the
      sympathy of the West lay with the insurgents.

      It would not be difficult for intelligence agencies to manipulate Islamic extremists from behind the scenes,
      organise funds and arms for them, and even have them claim responsibility. This would be standard practice to
      ensure deniability. The fact that ISIS has claimed responsibility for the Crocus City Hall attack does not
      definitively close the matter.

      If it was ISIS that was behind this monstrous act of terror, the four suspects arrested and interrogated do not
      fit into the profile of ideologically committed Islamic extremists. They do not come across as persons ready for
      martyrdom for a cause they deeply believe in. Rather, they come across as small-time mercenaries, ready to do a
      job, however heinous, for some money.

      The narrative propagated by some in the West, and in Ukraine in particular, that this is a false-flag operation
      carried out by Russian agencies in order to create grounds for more mobilisation of troops and an all-out
      assault on Ukraine, is going too far.

      Russia does not need the excuse of a major terror attack to step up its operations against Ukraine. With
      President Macron ready to send French troops into Ukraine – 2,000 soldiers to begin with, according to the
      Russian intelligence chief Naryshkin – and General Pierre Schill of France expressing French readiness to show
      “strength” in an Op-Ed in Le Monde, the Baltic states egging for NATO intervention in Ukraine, the move to
      supply F16s to Ukraine, the clear warning by Russia that French/NATO troops would be legitimate targets, are
      enough reasons for a worsening military conflict in Ukraine.

      Ukraine could have officially distanced itself from the Moscow attack in sober language. Instead, President
      Zelensky has abusively attacked Putin and Russia. It does not help Ukraine’s case.

      <p>The mayor of Paris has reiterated her proposal that Russian and Belarusian contestants stay away from this
        summer’s Olympic Games in the French capital, despite them being officially allowed to compete as neutrals.

        “I want to tell the Russian and Belarusian athletes that they are not welcome in Paris,” Anne Hidalgo told
        Ukrainian athletes at a training center in Kiev on Thursday, while on a visit to Ukraine.

        The International Olympic Committee (IOC) initially pushed for a complete ban on competitors from Russia and
        Belarus after the outbreak of the Ukraine conflict in February 2022. However, last December the IOC ruled that a
        limited number of people from the two countries could participate as AINs (individual neutral athletes).”
        Hidalgo told Reuters earlier this month that she would prefer for Russian and Belarusian contestants not to come
        at all. “We cannot act as if [the Russian military operation in Ukraine] did not exist,” she told Reuters.

        When asked about Israel’s Olympic participation – in the context of the Gaza war, raging since the Hamas attack
        on October 7 – Hidalgo insisted there was no comparison to be made.

        Sanctioning Israeli athletes is “out of the question because Israel is a democracy,” she stated.

        Russia has slammed the IOC’s difference in approach to Israeli and Russian contestants. Russian Foreign Minister
        Sergey Lavrov has accused the Switzerland-based body of “political activism” and called its approach
        self-discrediting.

        The maximum numbers of Russian and Belarusian athletes that can qualify for the upcoming games are 55 and 28,
        respectively. The IOC has noted that the teams are unlikely to actually meet the quota, with some 36 Russian and
        22 Belarusian athletes expected to make it to the games, according to IOC director James Macleod.

        Participants from the two nations can only compete in individual events, and not team sports, under a neutral
        flag, and are barred from the Olympic opening ceremony.

        Commenting on the restrictions faced by Russian and Belarusian competitors, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said
        the move “destroys Olympic ideals and discriminates against the interests of Olympians.” Such restrictions run
        “absolutely contrary to the entire ideology of the Olympic movement,” he insisted.
