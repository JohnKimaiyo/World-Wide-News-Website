      <h5 class="card-title">Netherlands to field Patriot missiles close to Russian border</h5>
      <p class="card-text">The Dutch air defense unit will hold NATO “readiness” drills in Lithuania</p>
      <p>The Netherlands will deploy a Patriot air defense unit to its NATO ally Lithuania as part of a summer joint air
        defense exercise, the Dutch Defense Ministry announced this week.

        The several-week-long drill is essential to strengthening air defenses on the eastern flank, the Dutch military
        claimed in a press release on Thursday. The stated goal is to test the ability of NATO troops to quickly
        transport and deploy such units to a given area. The decision to position a US-made system near the Russian
        border “contributes to the readiness of NATO air defense,” Dutch Defense Minister Kajsa Ollongren claimed in the
        release.

        Vilnius welcomed the exercise as excellent news, noting the Dutch will be training in the no-notice redeployment
        of such units alongside the Lithuanian armed forces. The US-led military bloc’s Enhanced Forward Presence forces
        are “vital for the Baltic states’ security,” Defense Minister Laurynas Kasciunas said on Friday, calling for
        more deployments and exercises involving NATO aircraft and ground-based air defense systems in her country.

        It’s unclear what the Dutch deployment of Patriot units in Lithuania will entail. A single battery of the air
        defense system consists of multiple truck-mounted units, including power, radar, antenna, engagement control and
        other support vehicles, as well as up to eight launchers with interceptor missiles.

        The Netherlands has been one of the few countries to supply two of their Patriot launchers to Ukraine, along
        with the US and Germany, which each sent a full battery.

        The deployment will follow NATO’ ongoing military exercise Steadfast Defender 2024, one of the biggest in
        decades, which features some 90,000 troops, more than a thousand combat vehicles, over 50 naval vessels, 80
        helicopters, drones and fighter jets from all 32 member states.

        Russia has stated the US-led military bloc’s increased military spending and increasingly frequent military
        drills demonstrate its “increasingly aggressive nature.” The drills are practicing a “scenario of armed
        confrontation with Russia,” increasing tensions and destabilizing the world, Russian Security Council secretary
        Nikolay Patrushev said in early March.

        Patrushev described NATO as “an important tool of Washington’s influence on other countries,” which, over the 75
        years of its existence as a self-described guarantor of peace and democracy “unleashed more than a hundred wars
        and military conflicts around the world and is getting ready for more.”

      <p>The mayor of Paris has reiterated her proposal that Russian and Belarusian contestants stay away from this
        summer’s Olympic Games in the French capital, despite them being officially allowed to compete as neutrals.

        “I want to tell the Russian and Belarusian athletes that they are not welcome in Paris,” Anne Hidalgo told
        Ukrainian athletes at a training center in Kiev on Thursday, while on a visit to Ukraine.

        The International Olympic Committee (IOC) initially pushed for a complete ban on competitors from Russia and
        Belarus after the outbreak of the Ukraine conflict in February 2022. However, last December the IOC ruled that a
        limited number of people from the two countries could participate as AINs (individual neutral athletes).”
        Hidalgo told Reuters earlier this month that she would prefer for Russian and Belarusian contestants not to come
        at all. “We cannot act as if [the Russian military operation in Ukraine] did not exist,” she told Reuters.

        When asked about Israel’s Olympic participation – in the context of the Gaza war, raging since the Hamas attack
        on October 7 – Hidalgo insisted there was no comparison to be made.

        Sanctioning Israeli athletes is “out of the question because Israel is a democracy,” she stated.

        Russia has slammed the IOC’s difference in approach to Israeli and Russian contestants. Russian Foreign Minister
        Sergey Lavrov has accused the Switzerland-based body of “political activism” and called its approach
        self-discrediting.

        The maximum numbers of Russian and Belarusian athletes that can qualify for the upcoming games are 55 and 28,
        respectively. The IOC has noted that the teams are unlikely to actually meet the quota, with some 36 Russian and
        22 Belarusian athletes expected to make it to the games, according to IOC director James Macleod.

        Participants from the two nations can only compete in individual events, and not team sports, under a neutral
        flag, and are barred from the Olympic opening ceremony.

        Commenting on the restrictions faced by Russian and Belarusian competitors, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said
        the move “destroys Olympic ideals and discriminates against the interests of Olympians.” Such restrictions run
        “absolutely contrary to the entire ideology of the Olympic movement,” he insisted.
