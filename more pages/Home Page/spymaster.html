      <h5 class="card-title">How America’s top spymaster sees the world and why it’s so disappointing</h5>
      <p class="card-text">The CIA head’s vision for the future of America’s ongoing confrontation with Russia is
        depressingly shortsighted/p>
      <p>William J. Burns has published a long piece in Foreign Affairs under the title 'Spycraft and Statecraft.
        Transforming the CIA for an Age of Competition'. This is an essay likely to be read with great attention, maybe
        even parsed, not only by an American elite audience, but also abroad, in, say, Moscow, Beijing, and New Delhi,
        for several reasons. Burns is, of course, the head of the CIA as well as an acknowledged heavyweight of US
        geopolitics – in the state and deep-state versions.

        Few publications rival Foreign Affairs’ cachet as a US establishment forum and mouthpiece. While Burns’ peg is a
        plea to appreciate the importance of human intelligence agents, his agenda is much broader: In effect, what he
        has released is a set of strategic policy recommendations, embedded in a global tour d’horizon. And, last but
        not least, Burns is, of course, not the sole author. Even if he should have penned every line himself, this is a
        programmatic declaration from a powerful faction of the American “siloviki,” the men (and women) wielding the
        still gargantuan hard power of the US empire.

        By the way, whether he has noticed or not, Burns’ intervention cannot but bring to mind another intelligent spy
        chief loyally serving a declining empire. Yury Andropov, former head of the KGB (and then, for a brief period,
        the whole Soviet Union) would have agreed with his CIA counterpart on the importance of “human assets,”
        especially in an age of technological progress, and he would also have appreciated the expansive sweep of Burns’
        vision. Indeed, with Burns putting himself so front-and-center, one cannot help but wonder if he is not also,
        tentatively, preparing the ground for reaching for the presidency one day. After all, in the US, George Bush
        senior famously went from head of the CIA to head of it all, too.

        There is no doubt that this CIA director is a smart and experienced man principally capable of realism, unlike
        all too many others in the current American elite. Famously, he warned in 2008, when serving as ambassador to
        Moscow, that “Ukrainian entry into NATO is the brightest of all redlines for the Russian elite (not just
        Putin).” That makes the glaring flaws in this big-picture survey all the more remarkable.

        Read more US trying to cover up ‘something’ related to Moscow terror attack – Kremlin
        Burns is, obviously, correct when he observes that the US – and the world as a whole – is facing a historically
        rare moment of “profound” change in the global order. And – with one exception which we will return to – it
        would be unproductive, perhaps even a little churlish, to quibble over his ideologically biased terminology. His
        mislabeling of Russia as “revanchist,” for instance, has a petty ring to it. “Resurgent” would be a more civil
        as well as more truthful term, capturing the fact that the country is simply returning to its normal
        international minimum status (for at least the last three hundred years), namely that of a second-to-none great
        power.

        Yet Burns’ agenda is more important than his terminology. While it may be complex, parts of it are as clear as
        can be: He is eager (perhaps desperate) to prevent Washington from ending its massive aid for Ukraine – a battle
        he is likely to lose. In the Middle East, he wants to focus Western aggression on Iran. He may get his will
        there, but that won’t be a winning strategy because, in part thanks to multipolar trend setters, such as the
        Shanghai Cooperation Organization and BRICS, Iran’s escape from the isolation that the US has long imposed on it
        is already inevitable.

        Regarding China, Burns’ real target is a competing faction of American hawks, namely those who argue that,
        bluntly put, Washington should write off its losses in Ukraine and concentrate all its firepower on China. Burns
        wants to persuade his readers that the US can have both its big fight against China and its proxy war against
        Russia.

        He is also engaged in a massive act of CIA boosterism, clearly aiming to increase the clout of the already
        inordinately powerful state-within-a-state he happens to run himself. And last but not least, the spy-in-chief
        has unearthed one of the oldest tricks in the subversion and destabilization playbook: Announcing loudly that
        his CIA is on a recruiting spree in Russia, he seeks to promote a little paranoia in Moscow. Good luck
        attempting to pull that one on the country that gave us the term “agentura.” Moreover, after the horrific terror
        attack on Crocus City Hall in Moscow, it is fair to assume that Burns regrets having boasted about the CIA
        expanding its “work” in Russia. Not a good look, not at all.</p>


      What matters more, though, than his verbal sallies and his intriguingly straightforward, even blunt aims, are
      three astonishingly crude errors: First, Burns insists on reading the emerging outcome of the war in Ukraine as
      a “failure on many levels,” for Russia, revealing its, as he believes, economic, political, and military
      weakness. Yet, as the acknowledged American economist James K. Galbraith has recently reiterated, the West’s
      economic war on Russia has backfired. The Russian economy is now stronger, more resilient, and independent of
      the West than never before.

      As to the military, Burns for instance, gleefully counts the tanks that Russia has lost and fails to note the
      ones it is building at a rapid rate not matched anywhere inside NATO. In general, he fails to mention just how
      worried scores of Western experts have come to be, realizing that Moscow is overseeing a massive and effective
      expansion of military production. A curious oversight for an intelligence professional. He also seems to miss
      just how desperate Ukraine’s situation has become on the ground.

      The US has sacrificed a common anti-terror principle to stick it to Putin

      And politics – really? The man who serves Joe Biden, most likely soon to be replaced by Donald Trump, is
      spotting lack of popularity and fragility in Moscow, and his key piece of evidence is Prigozhin and his doomed
      mutiny? This part of Burns’ article is so detached from reality that one wonders if this is still the same
      person reporting on Russian red lines in 2008. The larger point he cannot grasp is that, historically, Russia
      has a pattern of starting wars on the wrong foot – to then learn, mobilize, focus, and win.

      Burns’ second severe mistake is his argument that, ultimately, only China can pose a serious challenge to the
      US. This is staggeringly shortsighted for two reasons: First, Russia has just shown that it can defeat the West
      in a proxy war. Once that victory will be complete, a declining but still important part of the American empire,
      NATO/EU-Europe will have to deal with the after-effects (no, not Russian invasion, but political backlash,
      fracturing, and instability). If Burns thinks that blowback in Europe is no serious threat to US interests, one
      can only envy his nonchalance.

      Secondly, his entire premise is perfectly misguided: It makes no sense to divide the Russian and the Chinese
      potentials analytically because they are now closely linked in reality. It is, among other things, exactly a US
      attempt to knock out Russia first to then deal with China that has just failed. Instead, their partnership has
      become more solid.

      And error number three is, perhaps, even odder: As mentioned above, Burns’ language is a curious hybrid between
      an analytical and an intemperate idiom. A sophisticated reader can only wince in vicarious embarrassment at
      hearing a CIA director complain of others’ “brutish” behavior. What’s worse: the tub-thumping or the
      stones-and-glasshouse cringe? Mostly, though, this does not matter.

      Yet there is one case where these fits of verbal coarseness betray something even worse than rhetorical bravado:
      Describing Hamas’ 7 October assault as “butchery,” Burns finds nothing but an “intense ground campaign” on
      Israel’s side. Let’s set aside that this expression is a despicable euphemism, when much of the world rightly
      sees a genocide taking place in Gaza, with US support. It also bespeaks an astounding failure of the strategic
      imagination: In the same essay, Burns notes correctly that the weight of the Global South is increasing, and
      that, in essence, the great powers will have to compete for allegiances that are no longer, as he puts is,
      “monogamous.” Good luck then putting America’s bizarre come-what-may loyalty to Israel first. A CIA director at
      least should still be able to distinguish between the national interests of his own country and the demands of
      Tel Aviv.

      Burns’ multipronged strike in the realm of elite public debate leaves an unpleasant aftertaste. It is genuinely
      disappointing to see so much heavy-handed rhetoric and such basic errors of analysis from one of the less
      deluded members of the American establishment. It is also puzzling. Burns is not amateurish like Antony Blinken
      or a fanatic without self-awareness, such as Victoria Nuland. Yet here he is, putting his name to a text that
      often seems sloppy and transparent in its simple and short-sighted motivations. Has the US establishment decayed
      so badly that even its best and brightest now come across as sadly unimpressive?

      <p>Indian pharmaceutical companies have increased their presence in Russia after Western competitors withdrew from
        the market in the wake of the sanctions against Moscow, Satya Karm Punia, the president of Moscow-based Rus
        Biopharm Group, said in an interview to RT.

        India became Russia’s largest supplier of pharmaceuticals last year, filling the recent void left by previously
        dominant Western firms. “Because of the relationship that [India and Russia share], I am sure the Indian
        pharmaceutical companies have a good role to play in Russia,” the Indian businessman said. His group’s
        manufacturing facility is located in the special economic zone in the city of Dubna near Moscow.

        Punia noted that in the past two years, since the outbreak of the conflict in Ukraine and increasing sanctions
        pressure on businesses, India has started supplying to Russia a host of the raw materials used to manufacture
        medicines, effectively replacing the Western suppliers that previously had a strong presence in the market.
        Punia claimed that Russia would derive a “price benefit” for its domestically produced medicines if it sourced
        more raw materials from India. “The medicines would get cheaper, which means [it would be] more accessible for
        the regular people; that is a huge benefit.”

        The businessman termed India’s increasing forays into the Russian market a “big opportunity” for the South Asian
        nation. According to Punia, around 15-20 Indian pharmaceutical companies are already working in Russia, although
        just a few have established manufacturing units in the country.


        India recently replaced Germany as the top supplier of medicines to Russia. Indian manufacturers ramped up
        exports by 3% last year, delivering nearly 294 million packages of medicine to Russia. Germany was Russia’s top
        supplier in 2021 and 2022, RBK reported earlier this week, citing data compiled by the consultancy RNC Pharma.
        Mumbai-based Oxford Laboratories was one of the top suppliers to Russia last year, boosting exports by 67% to
        4.8 million packages, the data showed.

        Many Western pharmaceutical companies have suspended their non-essential work and investments in Russia over the
        Ukraine conflict, while several key global pharma producers, including Eli Lilly, Bayer, Pfizer, MSD, and
        Novartis, have also halted new clinical trials in Russia. “Interestingly, health care is not under sanctions,”
        Punia said. “But somehow, the big pharma – maybe not formally – are under pressure to stop investing in Russia
        [and] to stop supplies of important medicines.” Describing the situation as “morally wrong,” Punia asserted that
        big pharma companies are losing an important market and thus “damaging themselves.”
