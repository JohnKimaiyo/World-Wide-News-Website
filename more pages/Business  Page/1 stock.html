        U.S. stocks ended slightly higher on Thursday to notch another winning week as the S&P 500 closed out its
        strongest first quarter in five years.

        The benchmark index rallied 10.2% in the first three months of the year for its best Q1 gain since 2019.
        Meanwhile, the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average added 5.6% during the period for its strongest
        first-quarter performance since 2021.

        The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ended the quarter with a gain of 9.1%.

        The week ahead is expected to be another busy one as the second quarter kicks off and investors continue to
        gauge the path for the Federal Reserve’s interest rate outlook.

        Most important on the economic calendar will be Friday’s U.S. employment report for March, which is forecast to
        show the economy added 198,000 positions, compared to jobs growth of 275,000 in February. The unemployment rate
        is seen holding steady at 3.9%.

        Ahead of the jobs report, the ISM manufacturing and services PMIs will also be closely watched.

        Those releases will be accompanied by a heavy slate of Fed speakers, with the likes of district governors John
        Williams, Loretta Mester, Mary Daly, and Thomas Barkin set to make public appearances.

        Meanwhile, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will participate in a moderated discussion before Stanford University's
        Business, Government, and Society Forum on Wednesday.

        Traders now see about a 60% chance of the first rate cut hitting in June, according to the Investing.com Fed
        Monitor Tool, down from over 80% just a few weeks ago.

        Regardless of which direction the market goes, below I highlight one stock likely to be in demand and another
        which could see fresh downside. Remember though, my timeframe is just for the week ahead, Monday, April 1 -
        Friday, April 5.

        Stock to Buy: Fortinet
        I expect Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) to outperform this week as the cybersecurity solutions provider hosts its highly
        anticipated ‘Accelerate 2024’ event, at which it is likely to show off its latest advancements in AI
        applications.

        The four-day conference, titled ‘Step Into the Platform Era’, will kick off on Monday from the Mandalay Bay
        Convention Center, in Las Vegas.


        Most of the spotlight will fall on founder and CEO Ken Xie’s keynote speech scheduled for Tuesday at 12:00PM
        PDT/9:00AM EST.

        According to the description, Xie will showcase cutting-edge strategies and provide invaluable insights into how
        emerging trends and innovations in modern artificial intelligence are driving transformation in the rapidly
        evolving digital economy.

        Furthermore, other key members of Fortinet’s leadership team are expected to reveal fresh details on the
        cybersecurity specialist’s intrusion prevention systems and endpoint security components.

        Now in its eighth year, shares of Fortinet tend to rally during the week of its annual ‘Accelerate’ event. At
        its last conference in April 2023, FTNT shares jumped after Xie highlighted new cybersecurity features and
        functions.

        FTNT stock ended Thursday’s session at $68.31, within sight of its 2024 peak of $73.91 reached on February 7.
        The Sunnyvale, California-based network-security firm has a valuation of $52.1 billion.

        Shares have been on a major uptrend since the start of the year, gaining about 17% so far in 2024, as the
        security-software maker benefits from strong demand from large enterprises for its cloud-based security
        solutions.

        As ProTips points out, Fortinet has a near-perfect Financial Health Score of 4/5, thanks to robust earnings and
        sales growth prospects.

        It is also worth noting that the quantitative models in InvestingPro point to a potential upside of 6.7% in FTNT
        stock, which would bring shares closer to their Fair Value price target of about $73.

        Stock to Sell: Tesla
        I believe Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) will suffer a disappointing week ahead, as the struggling electric vehicle maker’s
        first quarter delivery numbers will likely underwhelm investors due to the negative impact of various headwinds
        on its business.

        Tesla will report Q1 deliveries sometime on Tuesday and results are expected to take a hit from soft demand in
        China and Europe, as well as production outages at its Shanghai, and Berlin factories.

        The Elon Musk-led EV pioneer is expected to have shipped around 457,000 vehicles in the first three months of
        the year, as per consensus estimates.

        However, sell-side sentiment has been extremely bearish in the days leading up to the report, with several
        analysts - including those at Goldman Sachs, Citibank, and Deutsche Bank - lowering their Q1 estimates for the
        period to around 420,000 deliveries.

        By comparison, Tesla delivered 484,507 vehicles in Q4 and 422,875 in the first quarter of 2023.

        Despite its price-slashing strategy and various incentives to customers in the U.S., China, and Europe, Tesla
        has been struggling with demand concerns and elevated inventory levels amid the current environment.

        The ongoing price cuts have fueled concerns that it is having to offer discounts on its vehicles to retain
        market share in the face of weakening demand and growing competition from traditional legacy automakers as well
        as Chinese EV startups, such as BYD (SZ:002594), Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI), and Xpeng (NYSE:XPEV).

        TSLA stock closed at $175.79 on Thursday, not far from a recent year-to-date low of $160.51 touched on March 14.
        At its current valuation, the Austin, Texas-based EV giant has a market cap of $560 billion.

        It should be noted that Tesla shares plunged 29% in the first quarter to earn the dubious title of the worst
        performing stock in the S&P 500 during the first three months of 2024.

        Tesla is scheduled to report first quarter earnings on April 24. Underscoring several near-term challenges
        facing Tesla amid the current environment, 12 out of the 13 analysts surveyed by InvestingPro cut their profit
        estimates in the past 90 days to reflect a drop of roughly 50% from their initial expectations.

        Tesla Earnings Forecast

        Consensus estimates call for a profit of $0.59 per share, plunging 31% from EPS of $0.85 in the same quarter
        last year. Revenue is forecast to increase less than 4% annually to $24.19 billion.

      Although discussions about the restitution of African artifacts predate independence in most African countries,
      they intensified in the latter half of the 20th century. Archaeologist and Nigeria’s head of the Federal
      Department of Antiquities, Ekpo Eyo, sent circulars to several European embassies in 1972 about the repatriation
      of the Benin Bronzes (thousands of 14th- to 16th-century plaques and sculptures taken by the British from the
      African Kingdom of Benin in the late 19th century) and spurred official pronouncements like the 1970 UNESCO
      Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export, and Transfer of Ownership of
      Cultural Property. This convention offers a shared framework among state parties regarding actions required to
      prohibit and prevent cultural property import, export, and transfer.

      The convention emphasizes that the return and restitution of these cultural properties are the linchpin of the
      convention, which mandates safeguarding the identity of peoples and promoting peaceful societies to strengthen
      the spirit of solidarity and stifle the expansionary rise of black-market trades across the continent.

      After 150 years, the Ashanti Gold artifacts are held in various museums around the world, including major
      museums in Europe and North America. The British Museum in London holds 32 of the 39 historical artifacts, while
      seven treasures are at the Fowler Museum of the University of California in Los Angeles. Other minor artifacts,
      which receive little attention, are held in museums such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, the
      Musee du quai Branly-Jacques Chirac in Paris, and other smaller regional museums or private collections.

      In restitution efforts for the Ashanti Gold artifacts, complex legal and logistical hurdles are at play.
      Firstly, there has to be established provenance through examining documentation, archives, and historical
      records, owing to the difficulty arising from the long years of history and multiple transfers. Variations in
      international laws governing the repatriation of cultural property also add to the myriad of challenges.
      Transporting the artifacts from current holders to their destination and settling associated legal disputes or
      financial concerns provides further complication. Collaboration among international partners toward this is
      essential for successfully repatriating these artifacts.

      In conclusion, this extensive discussion about restitution aims to deepen existing Euro-African diplomatic
      relationships. The emphasis on restitution primarily lies in its utility as a building block for reconciliation;
      it aims to rectify pre-colonial injustices, foster international dialogue, and advance the growing bilateral
      trade between countries on both continents. The Ghana restitution experience will provide the policy framework
      and lead the roundtable engagement for restitution claims from other countries in Africa. As noted earlier, this
      action will not only demonstrate contrition but also make the most declarative statement from the West and other
      collaborators regarding their penitence during this ruinous expedition in colonial Africa.
