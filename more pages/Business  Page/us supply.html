      </h5>
      <p class="card-text">One of the country’s major ports was brought to a halt due to the accident </p>
      <br>

      <p>The collapse of Baltimore’s Francis Scott Key Bridge, which has cut off ocean routes to the city’s major port,
        is expected to cause severe disruptions to local transport and logistics, producing ripple effects on global
        supply chains.

        The four-lane bridge collapsed on Tuesday after being hit by the Singapore-registered container ship Dali,
        operated by Danish shipping giant Maersk. As a result of the accident, a large section of the 1.6-mile (2.6km)
        bridge collapsed into the Patapsco River, with multiple vehicles falling nearly 55 meters into the water.

        Built in the 1970s, the Francis Scott Key Bridge spans the Patapsco River, and is the only passage connecting
        the US’ ninth-biggest foreign trading port to the ocean. The Port of Baltimore is the country’s busiest maritime
        terminal for exports of vehicles.

        According to Maryland Governor Wes Moore, no other port in the country brings in more vehicles than Baltimore,
        with up to 850,000 cars and light trucks going in and out of its terminals annually. Parts used in vehicle
        assembly also pass through the port or across the bridge.

        The major hub for East Coast shipping also handles significant volumes of coal. During the second quarter of
        2023, the port’s facilities had the second-highest coal export capacities, data tracked by S&P Global shows.

        Ten ships are reportedly stuck inside the port, unable to leave as the collapsed bridge spanned the only way in
        and out of the harbor. Another 30 small cargo vessels, tug boats, and other craft are also trapped in the port.
        Nearly 40 ships heading for Baltimore were forced to divert.

        Commenting on the tragedy, US President Joe Biden said the bridge is vital to the economy, citing concerns about
        traffic and jobs connected to the port. He noted that the port supports around 15,000 jobs and that over 30,000
        vehicles used the bridge each day.

        Officials closed the port to ship traffic following the incident. Rescue efforts are underway as the authorities
        search for six people who are still missing.

      Although discussions about the restitution of African artifacts predate independence in most African countries,
      they intensified in the latter half of the 20th century. Archaeologist and Nigeria’s head of the Federal
      Department of Antiquities, Ekpo Eyo, sent circulars to several European embassies in 1972 about the repatriation
      of the Benin Bronzes (thousands of 14th- to 16th-century plaques and sculptures taken by the British from the
      African Kingdom of Benin in the late 19th century) and spurred official pronouncements like the 1970 UNESCO
      Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export, and Transfer of Ownership of
      Cultural Property. This convention offers a shared framework among state parties regarding actions required to
      prohibit and prevent cultural property import, export, and transfer.

      The convention emphasizes that the return and restitution of these cultural properties are the linchpin of the
      convention, which mandates safeguarding the identity of peoples and promoting peaceful societies to strengthen
      the spirit of solidarity and stifle the expansionary rise of black-market trades across the continent.

      After 150 years, the Ashanti Gold artifacts are held in various museums around the world, including major
      museums in Europe and North America. The British Museum in London holds 32 of the 39 historical artifacts, while
      seven treasures are at the Fowler Museum of the University of California in Los Angeles. Other minor artifacts,
      which receive little attention, are held in museums such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, the
      Musee du quai Branly-Jacques Chirac in Paris, and other smaller regional museums or private collections.

      In restitution efforts for the Ashanti Gold artifacts, complex legal and logistical hurdles are at play.
      Firstly, there has to be established provenance through examining documentation, archives, and historical
      records, owing to the difficulty arising from the long years of history and multiple transfers. Variations in
      international laws governing the repatriation of cultural property also add to the myriad of challenges.
      Transporting the artifacts from current holders to their destination and settling associated legal disputes or
      financial concerns provides further complication. Collaboration among international partners toward this is
      essential for successfully repatriating these artifacts.

      In conclusion, this extensive discussion about restitution aims to deepen existing Euro-African diplomatic
      relationships. The emphasis on restitution primarily lies in its utility as a building block for reconciliation;
      it aims to rectify pre-colonial injustices, foster international dialogue, and advance the growing bilateral
      trade between countries on both continents. The Ghana restitution experience will provide the policy framework
      and lead the roundtable engagement for restitution claims from other countries in Africa. As noted earlier, this
      action will not only demonstrate contrition but also make the most declarative statement from the West and other
      collaborators regarding their penitence during this ruinous expedition in colonial Africa.
