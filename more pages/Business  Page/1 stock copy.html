      <p></p>The final estimate for Q4 GDP growth in the U.S. is revised up to 3.4%, fueled by robust consumer spending and nonresidential fixed investment.
      A slight decrease in jobless claims to 210,000 further underscores the strength of the U.S. labor market.
      Reddit's shares continue to slide as the company becomes a target for short-sellers.

      This week's major events included an upward revision of US Q4 GDP growth, a larger-than-expected drop in initial jobless claims, a decline in Reddit stock as short sellers targeted it, and a surge in RH shares following a positive outlook.
      
      Q4 GDP Growth Adjusted Upward
      The US Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) reported in its final estimate that the U.S. economy grew at an annualized rate of 3.4% in Q4, higher than the previously estimated 3.2%.
      
      This revision was mainly due to increased consumer spending and nonresidential fixed investment, partially offset by a reduction in private inventory investment.
      
      Jobless Claims Dip, Highlighting a Robust Job Market
      The number of initial state unemployment claims decreased by 2,000, reaching a seasonally adjusted figure of 210,000 for the week ending March 23, which was below the economists' forecast of 212,000.
      
      This continued trend of low unemployment benefit applications indicates a strong economic environment.
      
      Reddit Shares Drop Further Amid Short-Sellers' Interest
      Reddit's (NYSE:RDDT) stock is falling for the second consecutive day as short-sellers reportedly set their sights on the company. Following its impressive debut last week, which saw a notable surge in its share price, the social media company attracted significant short-selling activity in its initial days on the market.
      
      After hitting a high of $74.90 on Tuesday, Reddit's share price fell by approximately 11% on Wednesday and an additional 14% on Thursday. Reuters reported on Wednesday that preliminary estimates from Ortex suggest that at least 7.1% of Reddit's freely traded shares have been shorted, based on 2.15 million shares out on loan.
      
      The decline in Reddit's stock on Wednesday was primarily triggered by a report from Hedgeye Risk Management, which added the stock as a short idea, predicting a potential 50% decrease in its price.
      
      RH Jumps on Optimistic Outlook
      RH (NYSE:RH), a retailer specializing in luxury home furnishings, saw its shares surge by over 17% on Thursday despite reporting Q4 results that fell short of Wall Street expectations for EPS and revenue, impacted by adverse weather and shipping delays.
      
      However, the company expressed optimism, anticipating demand trends to pick up throughout fiscal 2024. For the coming year, RH predicts a demand increase of 12% to 14% and revenue growth between 8% and 10%.
      
      In Q4, RH reported earnings of $0.72 on revenue of $738 million, missing analyst estimates of $1.69 and $778M, respectively.

      Markets are closed today for the Good Friday holiday in the US, but key data will still be released, including the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE), which is anticipated to influence the outlook for U.S. interest rates.
      
      Additionally, speeches from Fed Chair Jerome Powell and FOMC member Mary Daly are scheduled for today.

      Although discussions about the restitution of African artifacts predate independence in most African countries,
      they intensified in the latter half of the 20th century. Archaeologist and Nigeria’s head of the Federal
      Department of Antiquities, Ekpo Eyo, sent circulars to several European embassies in 1972 about the repatriation
      of the Benin Bronzes (thousands of 14th- to 16th-century plaques and sculptures taken by the British from the
      African Kingdom of Benin in the late 19th century) and spurred official pronouncements like the 1970 UNESCO
      Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export, and Transfer of Ownership of
      Cultural Property. This convention offers a shared framework among state parties regarding actions required to
      prohibit and prevent cultural property import, export, and transfer.

      The convention emphasizes that the return and restitution of these cultural properties are the linchpin of the
      convention, which mandates safeguarding the identity of peoples and promoting peaceful societies to strengthen
      the spirit of solidarity and stifle the expansionary rise of black-market trades across the continent.

      After 150 years, the Ashanti Gold artifacts are held in various museums around the world, including major
      museums in Europe and North America. The British Museum in London holds 32 of the 39 historical artifacts, while
      seven treasures are at the Fowler Museum of the University of California in Los Angeles. Other minor artifacts,
      which receive little attention, are held in museums such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, the
      Musee du quai Branly-Jacques Chirac in Paris, and other smaller regional museums or private collections.

      In restitution efforts for the Ashanti Gold artifacts, complex legal and logistical hurdles are at play.
      Firstly, there has to be established provenance through examining documentation, archives, and historical
      records, owing to the difficulty arising from the long years of history and multiple transfers. Variations in
      international laws governing the repatriation of cultural property also add to the myriad of challenges.
      Transporting the artifacts from current holders to their destination and settling associated legal disputes or
      financial concerns provides further complication. Collaboration among international partners toward this is
      essential for successfully repatriating these artifacts.

      In conclusion, this extensive discussion about restitution aims to deepen existing Euro-African diplomatic
      relationships. The emphasis on restitution primarily lies in its utility as a building block for reconciliation;
      it aims to rectify pre-colonial injustices, foster international dialogue, and advance the growing bilateral
      trade between countries on both continents. The Ghana restitution experience will provide the policy framework
      and lead the roundtable engagement for restitution claims from other countries in Africa. As noted earlier, this
      action will not only demonstrate contrition but also make the most declarative statement from the West and other
      collaborators regarding their penitence during this ruinous expedition in colonial Africa.
