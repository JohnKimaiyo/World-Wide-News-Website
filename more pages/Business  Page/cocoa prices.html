      <p class="card-text">The commodity broke above the $10,000-per-metric-ton mark on Tuesday for the first time ever
      </p>
      <br>

      <p>The price of cocoa beans surged to an all-time high on Tuesday, amid supply constraints in West Africa, which
        produces about 70% of the crop globally.

        Benchmark cocoa futures for May delivery on the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) in New York briefly spiked to
        $10,030 per metric ton in intraday trading before later easing to trade at around $9,625 per ton. It’s the first
        time the commodity broke above the $10,000 mark.

        Prices skyrocketed more than 150% in the last three months, and are up 255% since March 2023.

        Experts attribute the price spike to poor crops in West Africa as the two largest producers, Cote d’Ivoire and
        Ghana, have been struggling for months with extreme weather changes and cocoa-pod diseases.

        “As these two leading producing countries supply about two-thirds of global cocoa beans, any change in their
        production tends to have a significant impact on the cocoa market,” the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO)
        warned in a recent report.

        A significantly lower cocoa harvest is also expected in other cocoa-producing countries, such as Nigeria and
        Ghana.

        Global cocoa supply is projected to fall 8% in the 2023-2024 season compared to the previous 12 months,
        according to data by analytics and consulting firm GlobalData.

        Meanwhile, some chocolate manufacturers have already warned that rising cocoa bean prices may force them to pass
        on the cost to consumers.

      Although discussions about the restitution of African artifacts predate independence in most African countries,
      they intensified in the latter half of the 20th century. Archaeologist and Nigeria’s head of the Federal
      Department of Antiquities, Ekpo Eyo, sent circulars to several European embassies in 1972 about the repatriation
      of the Benin Bronzes (thousands of 14th- to 16th-century plaques and sculptures taken by the British from the
      African Kingdom of Benin in the late 19th century) and spurred official pronouncements like the 1970 UNESCO
      Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export, and Transfer of Ownership of
      Cultural Property. This convention offers a shared framework among state parties regarding actions required to
      prohibit and prevent cultural property import, export, and transfer.

      The convention emphasizes that the return and restitution of these cultural properties are the linchpin of the
      convention, which mandates safeguarding the identity of peoples and promoting peaceful societies to strengthen
      the spirit of solidarity and stifle the expansionary rise of black-market trades across the continent.

      After 150 years, the Ashanti Gold artifacts are held in various museums around the world, including major
      museums in Europe and North America. The British Museum in London holds 32 of the 39 historical artifacts, while
      seven treasures are at the Fowler Museum of the University of California in Los Angeles. Other minor artifacts,
      which receive little attention, are held in museums such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, the
      Musee du quai Branly-Jacques Chirac in Paris, and other smaller regional museums or private collections.

      In restitution efforts for the Ashanti Gold artifacts, complex legal and logistical hurdles are at play.
      Firstly, there has to be established provenance through examining documentation, archives, and historical
      records, owing to the difficulty arising from the long years of history and multiple transfers. Variations in
      international laws governing the repatriation of cultural property also add to the myriad of challenges.
      Transporting the artifacts from current holders to their destination and settling associated legal disputes or
      financial concerns provides further complication. Collaboration among international partners toward this is
      essential for successfully repatriating these artifacts.

      In conclusion, this extensive discussion about restitution aims to deepen existing Euro-African diplomatic
      relationships. The emphasis on restitution primarily lies in its utility as a building block for reconciliation;
      it aims to rectify pre-colonial injustices, foster international dialogue, and advance the growing bilateral
      trade between countries on both continents. The Ghana restitution experience will provide the policy framework
      and lead the roundtable engagement for restitution claims from other countries in Africa. As noted earlier, this
      action will not only demonstrate contrition but also make the most declarative statement from the West and other
      collaborators regarding their penitence during this ruinous expedition in colonial Africa.
